# MCI-prodigies
Database of analyzed Roman prodigies

Changelog:

14/05/2018 - Uploaded the data my thesis is based on. The file "Prodigia_DB_Dec-05_CPS.xlsx" was my basic workfile. It consists of tabulized data from Susanne W. Rasmussen's Public Portents in Republican Rome (Rasmussen 2003) coded with the use of Barrett's coding scheme (Barrett 2008) and subsequently labeled. This file however contains many links between certain cells, which might not be displayed correctly on other than Czech MS Excel versions (I might be wrong though). The file "Prodigia_DB_noRef_May-12_CPS_22-51_HighlightedHeader_OnlyRelevant712.xls" is a simple table containing only the data relevant for my thesis (a part of the "Prodigia_DB_Dec-05_CPS.xlsx" file), however with no refferences inbetween cells. The corresponding file "Prodigia_DB_noRef_May-12_CPS_22-54_RawData_OnlyRelevant712.csv" contains the same referenceless data, but in .csv so it might be more convenient for somebody's use. The last uploaded file is "MCI_Rsrch_procedureAnalysis_Apr-30_WRK.xlsx", which I used to make sense of all the articels written under the MCI theroy. It heleped me find some basic patterns with regards to some of the predictions that can be driven from the MCI theory.

12/05/2018 - Made a referenceless copy of the dataset in .xls, and a copy in semicolon-separated (i.e. “;”) .csv file (the names of both files differ only for my versioning system indicating time of edit, they're identical in content, regarding the data, though). The .xls file might be more suitable to work with maually than the .csv one, since it might be better readable (colors and formating of the cells, but basically just visual details). The files will be uploaded to this repository together with the working .xlsx file containtg also references inbetween some cells (e.g. prodigy categorization based on the presence of identified EVENT type concept) and all the helping sheets I used in my thesis in a few days, just after I upload my thesis and the data to my university's system. Still deciding if the raw data should be in two versions (one .xls and one .csv) or just in one of them.
