# MCI-prodigies
Database of analyzed Roman prodigies

Changelog:
12/05/2015 - Made a referenceless copy of the dataset in .xls, and a copy in semicolon-separated (i.e. “;”) .csv file (the names of both files differ only for my versioning system indicating time of edit, they're identical in content, regarding the data, though). The .xls file might be more suitable to work with maually than the .csv one, since it might be better readable (colors and formating of the cells, but basically just visual details). The files will be uploaded to this repository together with the working .xlsx file containtg also references inbetween some cells (e.g. prodigy categorization based on the presence of identified EVENT type concept) and all the helping sheets I used in my thesis in a few days, just after I upload my thesis and the data to my university's system. Still deciding if the raw data should be in two versions (one .xls and one .csv) or just in one of them.
